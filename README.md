## Overview
### Description
Application that lets musicians of all skill levels find band mates to play with. Stretch goal would be for app to also allow users to share videos from jam sessions.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Music / Social
- **Mobile:** Mobile first design, nearly all users would use the mobile app.
- **Story:** Allows musicians to find friends to play with and share content.
- **Market:** Anybody who plays an instrument, either at a beginner level, intermediate, or advanced.
- **Habit:** Users can find band mates all day long. They can try out different mates and share their performance videos. Very addicting in the same ways that Tinder is. The average user will likely open this app a few times a day, they would create content as well as consume it.
- **Scope:** The MVP of the app would just include matching with nearby musicians. P2 features would include the ability to include share performance videos and messaging inside the app. P3 features would include the ability to follow people (a la instagram) and see a feed of all the posts of people you follow.
